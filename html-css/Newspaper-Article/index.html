      <p class="text">
        After two years of construction and community consultation, Riverside
        Park welcomed visitors back this week with new walkways, native plant
        gardens, and a restored wetland area.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Residents gathered at the park's main entrance on Monday to celebrate
        the official reopening. The renovation — funded by the city and private
        donors — includes widened paths for accessibility, improved lighting,
        and several areas designed to support pollinators and bird life.
